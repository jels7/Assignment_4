# Assignment_4

This programs demonstrates basic operations on a singly linked list. It consists of the following functions:
    -Insertion at the front of the list 'void insertAtFront(Node* head, int data)'
      It inserts a new node with data at the beginning of the linked list.
    -Removal of the First Node
      Method 'Node* removeFirstNode(Node* head)'
      It removes the first node form the linked list and returns the updated head pointer.
    -Printing the LinkedList
      Method 'void printList(Node* head)'
      It prints the elements of the linked list in order
    -Getting Value at a Specified Position
      Method 'int getPositionValue(Node* head, int position)'
      It returns the value stored at the specified position in the linked list. If the position is out of range, it returns default value of -1.
    -Test Functions
      Two test functions to make sure the correctness of the linked list operations
      'Void testPrintListEmpty()' which tests printing an empty list
      'void testPrintList()' which tests printing a list with 5 elements
